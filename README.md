For this project, I built a Story Management System using Spring Boot. I directly connected the application to a database server by configuring the data source and using Hibernate as the ORM framework.

I used Spring Web to build RESTful APIs that allow clients to create, read, update, and delete stories. For database interaction, I leveraged Spring Data JPA, which is built on top of Hibernate. This allowed me to simplify data access and reduce boilerplate code while still taking advantage of Hibernate’s full capabilities.

I created a Story class and annotated it as an @Entity, mapping it directly to a database table. I also implemented a JPA repository to handle data operations like saving and retrieving stories.

Through this project, I gained solid hands-on experience with Hibernate, JPA, and REST API development, and I’m confident in my ability to build scalable, database-driven backend systems.
