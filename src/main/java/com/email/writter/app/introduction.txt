Hi, my name is Tyler Zhang. I recently graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Over the past few years, I’ve gained solid experience in full-stack development, backend engineering, and cloud-based deployments. I have a strong passion for building scalable systems with Java Spring Boot, and I’ve worked on several hands-on projects, like developing an AI-powered Email Reply Generator and a full Story Management System using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and RESTful APIs. Beyond my coursework, I’ve also worked in professional settings, developing backend systems and mobile apps at stoneye.ai, and contributing to AI training data research at Virginia Tech. I’m excited to bring my skills in Spring development, API design, and database management to real-world challenges, and I’m looking forward to learning and growing further in this role.
